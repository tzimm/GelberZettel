Gelber Zettel:
The Idea for this program originates on my first program I've written in Visual Basic when I was a little boy.
It is basically a simplified form of gedit that saves changeds on the fly: A basic text editor that stays in the foreground and saves notes to the skript location.

When you usually have one open text file to take notes or use as an extended clipboard this program is for you.

Double click on the tab-bar with your left mouse button to create a new tab. 
Double click on the tab-bar with your right mouse button to delete the current active tab.

GelberZettel.py is the main python file

GelberZettelGui.py are the qt design files created from GelberZettel.ui with pyside-uic
